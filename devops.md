# Version Control (e.g., Git)

### GIT

All your resources (files) will be held in a GIT repository. Those files are application code but also infrastructure as a code.

Git is a free tool used for source code management. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

The two most popular Git platforms are **GitLab** and **GitHub**.

Here you need to learn Git commands, like git clone, branch, merge, and how to collaborate on a project with pull requests.

# Scripting and Automation (e.g., Python, Bash)

As an engineer, it is recommended to know at least one programming language that you can use to write automation scripts.

Some popular programming languages for DevOps-es are Python, Go, and JavaScript.

Python is a multi-paradigm language. Being an interpreted language, code is executed as soon as it is written, and the syntax allows for writing code in different ways. Python is frequently recommended as the first language new coders should learn, because of its focus on readability, consistency, and ease of use.

Here you need to learn basic concepts of programming languages, such as syntax, if/else, loops, data structures, etc.

# Linux Fundamentals (Command Line)

### Learn Linux & Scripting

An Operating system serves as a bridge between a computer's user and its hardware. Its function is to offer a setting in which a user can conveniently and effectively run programs.

As most servers use Linux OS, you need to make yourself comfortable with Linux and its CLI.

One easy-to-start distribution is Ubuntu.

In addition, you need to know scripting to automate tasks for development and operations.

Here you can learn OS-specific languages, such as Bash or Powershell, or independent, like Python or Go.

# Networking and Security

A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure, or design.

Here you will need to know how a network works, how to configure firewalls, understand how DNS works, **OSI model**, IP addresses, ports, etc.

# Cloud Platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

Cloud providers provide a layer of APIs to abstract infrastructure and provision it based on security and billing boundaries. The cloud runs on servers in data centers, but the abstractions cleverly give the appearance of interacting with a single "platform" or large application. The ability to quickly provision, configure and secure resources with cloud providers has been key to both the tremendous success, and complexity, of modern DevOps.

The most popular cloud providers in the market are AWS and Azure, as well as Google Cloud.

Here you need to know how to manage users and administration, networks, virtual servers, etc.

# Containerization (Docker)
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies, so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Docker is by far the most popular container technology today. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Here you need to know how to run containers, Docker Networking, Volumes, Dockerfiles, and run multiple containers with Docker-Compose.

# Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)

Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers.

Container orchestration can be used in any environment where you use containers. It can help you to deploy the same application across different environments without needing to redesign it. And microservices in containers make it easier to orchestrate services, including storage, networking, and security.

Here you need to learn how Kubernetes works, and how to administer the Kubernetes cluster and deploy applications on it.

# CI/CD

Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams.

CI/CD introduces continuous automation and continuous monitoring throughout the lifecycle of apps, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment. These connected practices are often referred to as a "CI/CD pipeline" and are supported by development and operations teams.

There are different stages of a CI/CD pipeline, such as: build, test and deploy, but there could be much more activities included:

- Checking code from version control and building it
- Having staged gates for different kinds of approvals
- Managing environment variables
- Restarting services
- Executing tests
- And more...

Here you need to learn how to set up CI/CD server, integrate code and trigger pipelines automatically, and build and package management tools.

Some popular CI/CD tools are Jenkins, TeamCity, CircleCI, Bamboo, GitLab, and Azure DevOps.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (e.g., Terraform)

Sometimes referred to as IaC, it refers to the techniques and tools used to define infrastructure, typically in a markup language like YAML or JSON. Infrastructure as code allows Engineers to automate environment setup and teardown. Accelerates and de-risks deployment by provisioning gold copy environments on demand.

Terraform is the most popular infrastructure provisioning tool, but there are others such as Ansimble, Chef, Puppet, and Vagrant.

Here you need to know how to do infrastructure provisioning and configuration management.

# Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring entails overseeing the entire development process from planning, development, integration and testing, deployment, and operations. It involves a complete and real-time view of the status of applications, services, and infrastructure in the production environment.

This is especially important when our software is in production, and we need to track all kinds of issues in our infrastructure and application.

The two most popular tools are Prometheus and Grafana.

Here you need to know how to set up monitoring and visualize data.

# Learn Software Engineering Practices

As a DevOps engineer, you will probably work in a team with other developers in an Agile world, such as Scrum. So, it is very important to know different parts of SDLC, as well as the tools which are used there.

In addition, it would be good to know how automation testing is working, as you will need to set up it in CI/CD way.

Here you need to know what is Scrum, all phases of SDLC, how automation testing works, etc.
